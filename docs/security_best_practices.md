# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices to ensure that the High-Performance Database System (HPDS) is secure against potential threats.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- Implement strong user authentication with OAuth 2.0 (`security/authentication/oauth2.go`) for all users accessing the system.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged access.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Use Role-Based Access Control (`security/authorization/rbac.cpp`) to assign fine-grained permissions to different user roles.
- Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and operations.

## Encryption

### Encryption at Rest

- Enable encryption for all data stored on disk using AES encryption in `security/encryption/encryption_at_rest.cpp`.
  
### Encryption in Transit

- Use TLS to encrypt data transmitted over the network (`security/encryption/encryption_in_transit.go`).

## Audit Logging

- Enable audit logging (`security/audit_logs.cpp`) to track all access and operations on the system.
- Regularly review audit logs to detect unauthorized access or anomalies.

## Firewall Configuration

- Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the system (`security/firewall.go`).
- Allow only trusted IP addresses and block all others.

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backups

- Regularly back up the database using the backup script (`scripts/backup.sh`) to ensure data is recoverable in case of an incident.

### Disaster Recovery

- Test the disaster recovery process periodically using the recovery mechanisms in `transactions/recovery/log_replay.cpp` and `transactions/recovery/checkpointing.cpp`.

## Regular Security Testing

- Conduct security tests regularly (`tests/security_tests.cpp`), including penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- Use automated security tools to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

Adopting these best practices will ensure the database system remains secure and resilient against common security threats.
