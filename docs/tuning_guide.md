# Performance Tuning Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on optimizing the performance of the High-Performance Database System (HPDS). It covers configurations, storage optimizations, and indexing strategies to enhance the system's efficiency and scalability.

## Configuration Settings

The following configurations in `config.yaml` can be fine-tuned to optimize the system performance:

### Memory Allocation

- **buffer_pool_size**: Increase buffer pool size to enhance caching efficiency. Recommended values depend on available system memory.
- **query_cache_size**: Adjust query cache size to store frequently used query results.

### Concurrency Settings

- **max_connections**: Configure the maximum number of concurrent connections the database can handle.
- **thread_pool_size**: Adjust the size of the thread pool for parallel query execution.

### Storage and I/O Optimization

- **disk_io_threads**: Increase the number of disk I/O threads for higher throughput.
- **compression_level**: Use LZ4 for faster compression or Snappy for balanced performance and compression ratio.

## Storage Engine Optimization

The storage engine is highly customizable for specific workloads:

### Compression Settings

- **LZ4 Compression** (`compression/lz4_compression.cpp`): Optimized for speed, suitable for high-throughput environments.
- **Snappy Compression** (`compression/snappy_compression.cpp`): Offers a balanced trade-off between speed and space.

### Buffer Management

- Tuning the buffer manager (`buffer_manager.cpp`) improves in-memory page caching, reducing disk I/O.

## Indexing Strategies

The indexing system allows flexibility to speed up query processing:

- **B-tree Index** (`indexing/b_tree/b_tree_index.cpp`): Recommended for range queries.
- **Hash Index** (`indexing/hash_index/hash_index.cpp`): Ideal for equality lookups.
- **R-tree** (`indexing/spatial_index/r_tree.cpp`): Efficient for spatial data queries.
- **Trie Index** (`indexing/trie_index/trie_index.cpp`): Best for prefix-based searches.
  
## Query Optimization

Enable query optimizations to improve query execution performance:

- **Cost Estimation** (`optimizer/cost_estimator.cpp`): Fine-tune the cost estimator to choose the most efficient query execution plan.
- **Join Algorithms** (`executor/join_algorithms.cpp`): Adjust the selection of join algorithms based on workload patterns (e.g., hash join for large datasets, merge join for sorted data).

## Sharding and Replication

For distributed systems, tuning sharding and replication is critical:

- **Range Sharding** (`distributed_systems/sharding/range_sharding.cpp`): Recommended for ordered data.
- **Hash Sharding** (`distributed_systems/sharding/hash_sharding.cpp`): Best for uniform distribution of data.
- **Master-Slave Replication** (`distributed_systems/replication/master_slave.cpp`): Useful for read-heavy workloads with one master and multiple read replicas.

## Benchmarking and Stress Testing

Regular performance testing is crucial for identifying bottlenecks:

- **TPC-C Benchmark** (`tests/performance_tests/tpc_c_benchmark.cpp`): Use for transactional workload performance measurement.
- **TPC-H Benchmark** (`tests/performance_tests/tpc_h_benchmark.cpp`): Test decision support queries with this benchmark.

Use these configurations and tools to fine-tune the system for optimal performance based on the workload characteristics.
